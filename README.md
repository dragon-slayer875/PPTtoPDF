# PPTtoPDF
A command line tool made in python that takes a template powerpoint presentation and automatically fills it with data from an excel file, giving PDFs as output.
It also gives PPTs in a different folder so that they can be edited too if needed. 
A folder is created on desktop during runtime automatically for storing the files.
